    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Digital Garage: Car Tracker is designed as a utility tool for vehicle management. We value your privacy and aim to collect the minimum amount of data possible:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> We store the vehicle details you input, such as brand, model, mileage, and maintenance logs. This data is used solely to provide the core functionality of the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Most of your data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or store your personal vehicle records on our own external servers unless you explicitly use a cloud backup feature (if available).</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> We may collect anonymous crash logs and performance metrics to help us identify bugs and improve the app's stability. This data is not linked to your identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. No Third-Party Advertising</h2>
    <p><strong>Digital Garage: Car Tracker does not display advertisements.</strong> We do not use third-party advertising SDKs (like Google AdMob), and we do not track your activity across other apps or websites for marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>To provide a complete experience, the App may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photo Library/Camera:</strong> To allow you to upload or take photos of your vehicle or maintenance receipts.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you reminders for upcoming maintenance or insurance renewals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your data seriously. Since most information is stored on your device, its security is also protected by your device's own security features (like FaceID, TouchID, or Passcode).</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. It is a utility tool intended for vehicle owners.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at:</p>
