    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
    <p>These terms and conditions apply to the <strong>Capsule: Routine Tracker</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Ching-Hao Fan</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service.</p>

    <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.</p>

    <p>Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

    <strong>Data Storage & Responsibility</strong>

    <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason.

    <p>The Application processes personal data that you provide to enable the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, as it could expose your device to malware, compromise security features, and cause the Application to malfunction.</p>

    <p>Please note that the Application may utilize third-party services (such as the Apple App Store for In-App Purchases) that have their own Terms and Conditions. By using this Application, you also agree to be bound by the terms of those third-party providers.</p>

    <p>Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or data allowance. Similarly, the Service Provider cannot assume responsibility if your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. You agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also cease providing the application at any time without providing termination notice. Upon termination, the rights and licenses granted to you will end, and you must cease using the application.</p>
