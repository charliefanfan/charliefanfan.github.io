    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Curated: Virtual Jewelry Box</strong>. We are committed to protecting the privacy of your collection. This policy explains how we handle your data and the steps we take to ensure your personal information remains secure while you curate your private gallery.</p>
    
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 5, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>To provide a seamless curatorial experience, manage premium features, and support our free model, this App may collect the following data through third-party partners (such as Google AdMob):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> We collect device-level identifiers (such as IDFA or IDFV) and User IDs to authenticate Pro memberships, deliver personalized advertisements, and measure ad performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase History:</strong> We track in-app purchases and subscription status to ensure your premium features—such as unlimited AI background removal and exclusive luxury themes—are accessible across all your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> We monitor interactions with advertisements (e.g., clicks and views) to facilitate proper ad delivery and track conversion.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about your interactions with the app, such as feature usage (e.g., image cutouts) and style analytics, to refine our App's functionality and aesthetic experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> We collect crash logs and performance metrics (e.g., app launch time and AI processing speed) to identify technical issues and maintain professional-grade stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Linkage and Tracking</h2>
    <p>In accordance with Apple’s guidelines, some collected data may be linked to your device identity. We and our third-party advertising partners may use this data to track your activity across other apps and websites for targeted advertising purposes. You can opt-out of this tracking at any time via your iOS system settings under <strong>Privacy & Security > Tracking</strong>.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We utilize specialized third-party SDKs to enhance our high-end services. These providers maintain their own privacy policies:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Media and Content Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your jewelry and collection images are personal. Our <strong>AI Background Removal</strong> feature is optimized to process images locally on your device. When cloud processing is necessary for complex cutouts, your photos are processed in real-time through secure channels and are <strong>not</strong> stored permanently on our servers or shared with any unauthorized third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
