        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: February 22, 2026</p>

        <p>At <strong>LeafCare</strong>, we believe that your data belongs to you. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to your privacy and explains that <span class="highlight">we do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any external servers.</span></p>

        <h2>1. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All information you enter into the App, including plant names, species, watering schedules, and care history, is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> (Local Storage). We do not have access to this data, and it is never uploaded to our servers.</p>

        <h2>2. Photos and Media</h2>
        <p>When you add a photo to your plant profile, the App requires access to your photo library. These images are processed locally on your device to create your plant records. <span class="highlight">Your photos are never transmitted to us or any third party.</span></p>

        <h2>3. iCloud Sync (If Applicable)</h2>
        <p>If you choose to enable iCloud synchronization, your data is transmitted directly to your personal Apple iCloud account for backup and multi-device syncing. This process is governed by Apple’s privacy policy, and we have no way to access or view your iCloud data.</p>

        <h2>4. No Third-Party Tracking</h2>
        <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising SDKs. We do not track your behavior, location, or usage patterns.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can modify or delete plant records within the App at any time. Deleting the App will remove all locally stored data permanently.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
