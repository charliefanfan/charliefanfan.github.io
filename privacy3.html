    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Capsule: Routine Tracker</strong> application (hereby referred to as "Application") created by <strong>Ching-Hao Fan</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Storage & Local Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application utilizes Apple's SwiftData technology to store all your routine records and maintenance data <strong>locally on your device</strong>. The Service Provider does not have access to this data, and <strong>your personal routine data is not shared with any third party except for advertising purposes as described in Section 2.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Advertising & Tracking (IDFA)</h2>
    <p>To support the free features of the Application, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. To provide a better user experience, the Application may request permission to track you using the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).</p>
    <p><strong>Tracking Purpose:</strong> This tracking is used to <strong>display personalized ads and measure advertisement performance</strong> across other apps and websites. Google AdMob may collect data such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address (used for general location estimation)</li>
        <li>Advertising IDs (IDFA)</li>
        <li>User interactions with ads and device information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can manage your tracking preferences in your iOS settings at any time. For more details, please visit: <br>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>All Pro-feature transactions are securely processed via the <strong>Apple App Store</strong>. The Service Provider does not collect, process, or store any financial or billing information.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>This Application is not intended for children under the age of 13.</strong> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can take necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since routine records are stored locally, you have full control over your data. Deleting the Application will permanently remove all locally stored data. Data collected by AdMob is retained according to Google's standard retention policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes are effective when posted on this page. Effective date: <strong>2026-01-10</strong>.</p>
