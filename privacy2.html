    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "Cat Chase: Fun Action Escape" application (referred to as "the App" or "we") collects, uses, and protects information in relation to your use of the App. The App uses third-party services, primarily Google's **Firebase Analytics** and **AdMob**, for core functionality, analysis, and revenue generation.</p>

    <h3>1. Identifiers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Used by Firebase to distinguish your device for analytical purposes, fraud prevention, and to measure the size of our user base.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers (IDFA/AAID):</strong> Used by AdMob to provide personalized or non-personalized advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Usage Data and Game Metrics (Analytics):</h3>

                <li><code>level_completed</code> and <code>level_failed</code> events.</li>
                <li>Associated parameters, including the <code>level_number</code>, <code>retries_count_at_fail</code>, and <code>failure_reason</code> (e.g., "Caught by the dog!").</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Ad views, clicks, and impressions used for measuring ad campaign performance.</li>

        <li><strong>Crash Data:</strong> Information recorded when the App crashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Data on launch time and power consumption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Optimization:</strong> To analyze game difficulty and balance based on collected metrics (e.g., using <code>failure_reason</code> data to adjust level design or dog AI).</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To evaluate user behavior, understand feature usage, and plan future game updates or content.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To display interstitial and rewarded advertisements through AdMob, which serves as the primary revenue source for the App's maintenance and development.</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> To monitor App stability, quickly identify and fix bugs, and improve overall performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>III. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share the collected data with the following essential service providers:</p>

        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used as our analytics platform for storing and processing all usage and diagnostic data.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used as our advertising network to manage and display advertisements within the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties are obligated to protect your information in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>IV. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Tracking:</strong> You can limit the use of your Advertising Identifier for personalized advertising by enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" feature (or equivalent) in your device's system settings. This will reduce the number of targeted ads you see but will not eliminate advertisements entirely.</li>
