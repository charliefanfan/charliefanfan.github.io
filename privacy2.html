    <h1>Privacy Policy for Cat Chase: Fun Action Escape</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 5, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "Cat Chase: Fun Action Escape" application (referred to as "the App" or "we") collects, uses, and protects information in relation to your use of the App. The App uses third-party services, primarily Google's <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> and <strong>AdMob</strong>, for core functionality, analysis, and revenue generation.</p>

    <h2>I. Information Collected (Via Third-Party Services)</h2>
    <p>The App does not directly collect personally identifiable information such as your name or email address. We automatically collect the following data through integrated third-party service providers:</p>

    <h3>1. Identifiers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Used by Firebase to distinguish your device for analytical purposes, fraud prevention, and to measure the size of our user base.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers (IDFA/AAID):</strong> Used by AdMob to provide personalized or non-personalized advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Usage Data and Game Metrics (Analytics):</h3>
    <p>This data is collected via <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> and helps us improve the game experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Interaction:</strong> Data related to how you use the App, including App launches, usage duration, taps, clicks, and specific game events.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Progress Data:</strong> Information about your progression, such as:
            <ul>
                <li><code>level_completed</code> and <code>level_failed</code> events.</li>
                <li>Associated parameters, including the <code>level_number</code>, <code>retries_count_at_fail</code>, and <code>failure_reason</code> (e.g., "Caught by the dog!").</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Ad views, clicks, and impressions used for measuring ad campaign performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Diagnostics:</h3>
    <p>Used to monitor the App's stability and performance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash Data:</strong> Information recorded when the App crashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Data on launch time and power consumption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Optimization:</strong> To analyze game difficulty and balance based on collected metrics (e.g., using <code>failure_reason</code> data to adjust level design or dog AI).</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To evaluate user behavior, understand feature usage, and plan future game updates or content.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To display interstitial and rewarded advertisements through AdMob, which serves as the primary revenue source for the App's maintenance and development.</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> To monitor App stability, quickly identify and fix bugs, and improve overall performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>III. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share the collected data with the following essential service providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used as our analytics platform for storing and processing all usage and diagnostic data.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used as our advertising network to manage and display advertisements within the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties are obligated to protect your information in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>IV. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Tracking:</strong> You can limit the use of your Advertising Identifier for personalized advertising by enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" feature (or equivalent) in your device's system settings. This will reduce the number of targeted ads you see but will not eliminate advertisements entirely.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>V. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>The usage and diagnostic data collected through Firebase Analytics and AdMob is retained in accordance with Google's data retention policies. We do not directly store or retain personal data on our own servers.</p>
    <p>Since the App does not collect personally identifiable information (PII), we do not offer a direct mechanism for PII deletion. Data deletion is managed by the policies of the respective third-party providers (Google Firebase and AdMob).</p>
    
    <h2>VI. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us immediately, and we will take steps to remove such information.</p>

    <h2>VII. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on this page, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
